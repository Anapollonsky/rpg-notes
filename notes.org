*** Gods
**** Lathander
 http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Lathander
***** Description
Lathander, whose title was The Morninglord, was a deity of creativity, dawn, renewal, birth, athletics, spring, self-perfection, vitality and youth.
***** Midsummer Festivities
http://www.nj-pbem.com/data/Gods/humangods/Lathander.htm
On special occasions, on Midsummer morning, and on the mornings of the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, priests of Lathander perform the Song of Dawn, praising Lathander with a blend of vocal harmonies and counterharmonies of beautiful complexity.
**** Oghma
http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Oghma
***** Description 
Oghma, also known as The Lord of Knowledge, was the neutral greater power of bards, inspiration, invention, and knowledge in Faerûn. Oghma was the leader of the Deities of Knowledge and Invention and his home plane was the House of Knowledge.
***** Midsummer Festivities
 http://www.nj-pbem.com/data/Gods/humangods/Oghma.htm
Midsummer and Shieldmeet are the most sacred days of the Oghmanyte calendar since they are occasions when agreements are made or renewed and many contracts, bonds, and the like are drawn up. However, a priest of Oghma must observe two solemn rituals every day: the Binding and the Covenant. The Binding is a morning service wherein the symbols of Oghma are written in the dirt, in ashes upon a stone altar, or in the mind if a clergy member happens to be shackled or otherwise unable to write, while a silent prayer of loyalty and praise is made to Oghma. The Covenant is an evening service during which a passage from some work of wisdom is read aloud or recited from memory, a song or poem is offered up to Oghma, and some item of knowledge that the clergy member has learned during that day is spoken aloud to the god and to any fellow clergy present.
**** Tymora
 http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Tymora
***** Description
Tymora, or more commonly Lady Luck, was the goddess of good fortune.
***** Midsummer Festivities
Midsummer is the most important festival of Tymora - a wild, nightlong revel of reckless, mischievous derring-do and romantic trysts. It is a time for the wandering clergy to gather and meet with Harpers, those of allied faiths and relatives. Many missions and plans are laid at such times.
**** Silvanus
 http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Silvanus
***** Description
Silvanus the Forest Father, was the god of nature, though formerly considered only the god of wild nature and druids. Silvanus was one of the oldest and most prominent deities in Faerûn, and the wilder counterpart to Chauntea the Earthmother. His worshipers protected places of nature from the encroachment of civilization with vigor and were implacable foes of industrious peoples.
***** Midsummer Festivities
Worshipers of Silvanus consider Midsummer Night holy, and often give sacrifice by breaking and burying an object constructed of wood.
**** Sune
http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Sune
***** Description
Sune, also known as Lady Firehair, was the deity of beauty, with governance also over love. Her dogma primarily concerned love based on outward beauty, with primary importance placed upon loving people who responded to the Sunite's appearance. Her symbol was that of a beautiful woman with red hair.
***** Midsummer Festivities
http://www.nj-pbem.com/data/Gods/humangods/Sune.htm
 Midsummer Night with night-long flirtatious chases through forests and parks, but local priesthoods can set the times of other celebrations to their own pleasure, as long as at least one Grand Revel befalls each month and at least one Feast of Love is celebrated in every tenday.

A Grand Revel is a dusk-to-dawn party to which outsiders are invited, dancing and minstrelsy dominate, and those of the faith seek to attract converts with fun and the exhibition of a few of a temple's or shrine's beautiful art objects or magical treasures. A Feast of Love is a more intimate, quiet affair, open only to the faithful, who lie on couches and indulge in the gentle sipping of liquers and nibbling at subtly flavoured bitelets (as savory hors d'oeuvres are called in the Realms) and sweet pastries while lone dancers perform. These dances are interspersed with readings of romantic verse and prose and lays of love sung by skilled minstrels. Such rituals always break up into private gatherings, though bards are always on hand to relate

**** Shar
http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Shar
***** Description
Shar, the Mistress of the Night, was the goddess of darkness and the caverns of Faerûn, as well as a neutral evil greater deity. Counterpart to her twin Selûne, she presided over caverns, darkness, dungeons, forgetfulness, loss, night, secrets, and the Underdark. Among her array of twisted powers was the ability to see everything that lay or happened in the dark. Shar's symbol was a black disk with a deep purple border. Shar was also the creator of the Shadow Weave, which was a counterpart and attack upon the Weave, controlled by Mystryl and her successors, before both of the Weaves fell into ruin during the Spellplague.

http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Midsummer
****** Description
Midsummer was a festival that celebrated love and music through feast. It occurred between 30 Flamerule and 1 Eleasis on the Calendar of Harptos. It was a time when love advanced, and it was said the deities themselves took a hand to ensure good weather. If bad weather was experienced on this night it was considered an extremely bad omen. Shieldmeet occurred the day after Midsummer on leap years.
***** Shieldmeet
http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Shieldmeet
****** Description
Shieldmeet was the equivalent of a leap year day in the Calendar of Harptos, occurring once every four years, adding a day after the festival of Midsummer and before Eleasis 1. Traditionally the day was used for fairs, bazaars, musical and theatrical performances, and tournaments of skill and magical ability. Nobles usually held court to hear the petitions of their people and to make or renew trade pacts, alliances, and agreements.

Shieldmeet was known as Cinnaelos'Cor (also seen as Cinnaeloscor), "the Day of Corellon's Peace" in elvish and marked the end of an aeloulaev and the beginning of a new one in the elven Aryselmalyn calendar.

*** Background
Growing up, Rurik Battlehammer was a typical Dwarf child, albeit on the
tall side. While some Dwarves find their interests in metals or gems,
Rurik took a greater interest in stonework. He loved stories of the
magnificent structures of Mithril Hall and other Dwarven kingdoms.
Indeed, he spent a significant amount of time searching through books
for everything he could find about their construction.

For a time, a human wizard visited the area near his home. Upon seeing
the wizard manipulating tools with a Mage Hand spell, Rurik became the
enamored with the idea of using magic for constructing great structures.
He convinced the wizard to teach him the basics of magic and decided to
leave his home to learn all that he could of magic and its applicability
to physical structures. At the wizards recommendation, he decided to
seek out the Elves and learn of their craftsmanship.

*** Notes given to Player
**** Background 
You are in a cage, 5' by 5'. There are more like yours in the room you're in; eight of them, arranged in a row. The room itself is maybe 40' x 10'. You haven't seen outside this room in a long time. Weeks, certainly. Possibly months.

You are hungry, and thirsty, and filthy. It wasn't always this way. It used to be you'd be regularly visited and drained by someone named Thenn, a vampire. It used to be you were cared for, provided with ample food and water and books. It wasn't much, but you've learned not to expect much. Not for a while, though. Thenn and his servants stopped visiting long ago. Stopped refilling your trough with water, stopped bringing food, stopped providing reading material. You miss them. 

You are not alone. A cell two to the right of yours is occupied by fellow cattle. You've talked to Farissa Mayfield at length; hers is a sad tale. Familial fiscal mismanagement, debts owed to bad people, the road leading to slavery and worse. She's holding up well in the cell. Better than you, in fact.

Two cells to the left of you is another cattle. You've seen her face once, when Thenn forced her to face him during a feeding. A halfling, a pretty thing. Without Thenn, she has no reason to face you. She huddles in the far corner of her cell, face towards the wall, mumbling incoherently in an unknown but pleasant-sounding tongue. You haven't seen her eat or drink since she got here; more recent than your own arrival, sure, but still far too long. It confuses you. You don't know her name.

There used to be one more, but there isn't anymore. Farissa ate most of him. She gave you some. You don't remember if you partook. Farissa's a nice girl. You're glad you're separated by a now-empty cell.

In the cell directly to your left is your nightmare. A skeleton is chained to the wall. It's been here since before you were placed in your cell. The skeleton has fifteen arms and four spines, and it talks to you. Not in real life, you're sane enough to know that much, but at night, in your dreams, every night, all nights. It used to talk of life outside, of all the things it missed. It was wistful. It used to talk of your hopes and dreams. Now you have none. Now it talks of darker things. You hope not to stay with it forever. It resents you for it.

It used to be better. When you were first acquired by the Thayans near Neverwinter, your tasks were mundane. Physical. You miss that, you feel atrophied. You'd held out hopes of being ransomed out, but it didn't come to pass. Then Thenn took a liking to you. The Thayans didn't have many vampires, and Thenn was clever, he had influence. You became his cattle. It was vile, disgusting, degrading, but easy. Until you were sent to the cursed tower. An opportunity had appeared. But not for you. You don't have much time left.
**** Rules
- Use the point-buy system for generating stats for your character; I'd like players to have roughly equal stats, die-throwing is too random.
- We're playing with advanced encumberence rules, detailed on the right column of page 176 of the players handbook. 15x your strength in pounds is maximum carry weight, >10x is heavily encumbered, and >5x is lightly encumbered. Shouldn't be a problem for you early on.
- We're playing with accounting for food/drink, lighting, and other stuff like that. I'm trying to emphasize some degree of realism.

*** Background
My (Bharash's) hometown was destroyed by a white dragon when I was a child. My father sacrificed himself to protect me and I was able to survive the dragon's attack because he painted me with his blood and hid me under his body. After the attack, I roamed the southern foothills of the Spine of the World alone and homeless. I begged for food and shelter when I could, but it wasn't enough to sustain me. I collapsed at a shrine to Tyr, and that's where the paladin found me. He took me as his squire because he saw something in me. He trained me and taught me to harness the anger that dwelled inside me into divine power. We roamed from town to town taking odd jobs and making a living that way, but I never forgot my true purpose: to exact vengeance on the white dragon that destroyed my clan. 

Tyrdron, the paladin, was a member of the Hammers of Grimmjaws, the elite of the paladins of Tyr. He took it upon himself to hunt down and extinguish demonic corruption from Toril. I followed him in his mission, and together we fought many devils from the nine hells. When it was time for me to become a fully fledged paladin, Tyrdron sent me on a quest to bring me closer to Tyr. While on my quest, he was killed in combat. He was taken back to Neverwinter to be buried at a temple of Tyr.

I was visiting his grave and praying for guidance on what the next steps in my mission to exterminate white dragons should be when I was captured by the Thayans. And you know what happens next. Let me know if anything is inconsistent with that and we can tweak it. :)
** Vamoner Besarkel (John D)
*** Initial Description
You are a high-ranking officer in the service of Gerard Mayworth, the Lord of Ethermaw. Several days ago, the young prince of the Kingdom of Carrowmaw, Mayard Tinn, had succumbed to his bleeding sickness. Due to the age of the king Richard Tinn (87) and the lack of a suitable heir, the prince's death has pushed the Kingdom into political disarray. This you know.

You've heard that Lord Gerard Mayworth is taking advantage of the weakness of the Kingdom to push for more autonomy, with an eye on the throne. Three days ago, Gerard started mobilizing his armies. This is common knowledge.

Four days ago, a tower had materialized in the outskirts of the Ethermaw City. Driven by curiosity, you've gone to see the tower from a distance -- you've seen how the gods themselves seem to reject it, striking it with lightning bolt upon lightning bolt without end, even when the sky is clear -- and you've seen the tower stand, undamaged, seemingly impregnable. You've heard that the wizard from the tower was seen visiting Lord Gerard at his estate shortly after its materialization. You've heard that this is connected to the mobilization. The timing adds up. It worries you.

Last night, a courier delivered a message asking for you to report to Gerard Mayworth at his estate. You've just arrived, observing that the estate is covered with military tents, soldiers milling around and training, peasants standing in line at a recruitment office, being inspected for military readiness.

You enter his mansion, recognized by the guards, and see Gerard conversing with four diverse adventurers -- shockingly, three of whom aren't human, which is rare in this racist kingdom. You overhear that these adventurers are to be part of a contingent responsible for securing the Pilar Griffon Training Compound to the southwest of the city. Gerard sees you enter, and says "You're here, {John}! Just in time. Your expertise is sorely needed here..."

- Global
- Three Torn Sisters (Chronia, Zamia and Charity) were born, and with their beauty and innocence led to the creation of a land of wonder and peace.
- They ruled for time immemorial, presiding over a golden age for the human race.
- In time, three of their advisors, envious and ambitious, decided that they could not allow the sisters to rule forever, and conspired to lock them away.
- They deviously led the three sisters to an evil Medusa, and bade her to keep the three sisters petrified for eternity. Where they are, to this day.
** The Legend of Cabell Manor
“The story starts with my ancestor, Richard Cabell, who built
this manor house some 400 years ago. He poured his heart
and soul into this place; it took years and years to build and
all-but bankrupted him. As soon as it was completed he made
some bad business deals that left him on the verge of losing it.
“According to the legend, Richard made a deal with dark
forces in order to keep hold of this place and ensure it would
never leave the family. In return he pledged to give up the life of
a Cabell, one every century. People say Richard allowed his
own son to be dragged into the family tomb by a foul
Hellhound.
“Of course, I never believed the story. When my father told
me about it I thought he was trying to scare me. But now… I
worry there may have been truth in it after all.”
** The Vision of Ariel 
*** Awaking
You groggily awake. You remember a dream; a wonderful dream of adventure and heroism, of success and failure. It was your adventure in Malgrief, where you with your friends first gained your griffons, the first step in the grand journey that would lead to this, the finest retirement an adventurer could ask for.

It's a good memory. You almost miss the danger, the excitement, the feeling of comraderie enhanced by the near-death situation. You look around. This is better. You're with your close friends at your shared home in the Sea Ward of Waterdeep; a beachside property, the finest in Waterdeep, the wealthiest city in Faerun. A unique amalgamation of nature and magic, splendor and joy. 

You fell asleep in the sun, you note with concern - that'll hurt tomorrow. 

In the distance is "The Thousand Hands", your flagship -- the swiftest and mightiest on the seas, all the better to scare off the pirates and protect your trade interests overseas. The sun shines in the gaps 'twixt her masts, blinding you as she sails back into port.

You glance around at your friends, lying near you, now also awakened -- also smiling dully. You hear a squawk from behind you -- it's your old companion Fairfeather, who you met at Malgrief. You look back, thankful that he's still with you after all these years. His feathers rustle, and he buries his beak under his wing, preening.

You look around and see what aroused Fairfeather's attention. It's Ariel, your once-captor and benefactor from your time in Carrowmaw Valley. You grin, thinking about how your relationship developed over the years -- from hated jailer, to close friend. Her tattoos glitter in the sunlight, and the sickly smell of brimstone engulfs you as she approaches. It's her worst quality.

--- Conversation in which Ariel tries to extract details about Uravulon ---

*** Medusa
A splash out towards the sea catches your attention. A snake is flailing unnatural, as if being whipped back and forth, the top half standing up out of the water almost vertically. It's severus. He looked ecstatic, yet crazed. For a snake.

The ground shakes. Rising out of the water, far larger than the water has any right being deep, rises a mountain, light blue. The sky, reflecting the mountain, loses some of its deep orange tint; it's as if day was returning.

You see before you a giant medusa head, the mountain, an arm, holding a deep blue mask, embroidered in gold, in front of her face. Her head is the size of a ship, the size of a small city, blotting out the sun. Her body meets the sea at her shoulders. You can no longer see "The Thousand Hands"; the head is far larger. The snakes in her head writhe excitedly, smelling you. 

Ariel stares silently at the vision; if shocked, not showing it.

The Medusa points one giant hand east. "Look" she says, a voice so deep that hearing and understanding it feels wrong.

You see the horizon. The land and the sky come together along a line in the distance. And the line approaches you. The horizon is coming. The land and the sky become one, become one unseeable one. You feel rumbling coming deep from the earth, getting stronger and stronger. It's as if a beast the size of a continent is approaching. It's coming at you.

The Medusa draws your attention with her hand, so large as to stretch across Waterdeep and further. She faces you. "Come to me" you hear. She slowly removes her mask.

Behind the mask you see nothing but blackness. Nothing but her eyes, black as the the darkest night in the deepest depths of the earth. A dark that hunts. Except the stars. The stars shine, but illuminate nothing. 

Then it gets lighter.

*** Real-awake
You awake. You're lying on your back, staring into the sky; morning is coming. The light of the stars is dimming, the sun about to peek out.

You see that you're lying near in the grass near the wall of Malgrief. What happened comes rushing back. You see that the wall was breached, only feet from where you lie; and yet, it looks like the defenders carried the day.

You see a tent parked ten feet away, where a wood elven woman is applying salve to the burned side of a griffon. The woman is wearing the local uniform, a green tunic and light brown leather armor. You see a large bloody patch along her right pant leg, and she walks with a light limp, but she cares for the animal briskly and energetically, cooing and comforting it. 

The griffon's indignant squawking is what woke you. Two men are standing guard nearby; one is grizzled and middle-aged, no uniform and with a bandaged right arm, holding a halberd in his left, gazing out into the forest, keeping watch. The other is younger and in uniform, green tunic and light brown leather armor. He has a bandage around the left side of his head; the lack of a bump suggests a missing ear. He's staring at you, and nudges the woman to make her aware. "They're awake."

The ground around you is littered with corpses, primarily unidentifiable, but many in Carrowmaw military uniforms. Forty feet towards the forest and away from the fort wall is a pyre, continuously being added to; civilians and militia working together to honor the dead. Four men are trying to drag the corpse of a griffon, wings and hind legs burned off and face missing all of its skin, to the pyre; it seems a futile task.

Spellcasters: Thumbs tied together.


**** Said by Alexis Siannodel
- Dispicable murderers. Korsantos was a great man. A rough man, but a great one. 
- May your gods forgive the evil you've done here this day. I have no such forgiveness in my heart. I hope the pyre consumes you. *spits*

*** Events
- A flock of griffons fly above you, heading west, out towards the sea.
